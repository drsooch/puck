# Puck

A TUI and CLI for the NHL. This project was originally created under python you can see that [here](https://github.com/drsooch/puck-python). This project is written in Haskell, as I wanted to have a project where I could really dive into the mechanics of Haskell. I was also not satisfied with the lack of type safety from python while I creating Puck.
